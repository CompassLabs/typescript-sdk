    description: `Withdraw Collateral from Market

Withdraw collateral that has been supplied to a Morpho Market.

A Morpho Market is a primitive lending pool that pairs one collateral asset with one
loan asset. Each market is isolated (meaning risks are contained within each
individual market), immutable (cannot be changed after deployment), and will persist
as long as the blockchain it is deployed on is live.
